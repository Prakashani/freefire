 <p style="font-size: 18px;">K character has finally arrived Free Fire. K design was inspired by the American DJ KSHMR. This is the second character in Free Fire that is based on a real-life DJ.

    In Free Fire, K is described as a professor and jiujitsu expert. His skill is called Master of All. This skill allows K to switch between 2 modes with different effects. This is the first time this mechanic appears in Free Fire so many players might not understand how this skill works.Max EP increases by 50.
    Jiujitsu Mode: Allies within 6 meters get a 500% increase in EP conversion rate.
    Psychology Mode: Recover 2 EP every 2 seconds, up to 150 EP. You can switch between 2 modes every  30 seconds.So you will basically have 250 Max EP and always be in 1 of these 2 modes.

    The Psychology Mode gives you 2EP every 2 seconds automatically, so you would want to be in this mode for most of the time. With this mode, you basically have a passive heal of 1 HP per second so you don't have to worry about taking chip damage. Since you can't go over 150 EP with this skill, you need to eat mushrooms to reach the maximum amount of 250 EP.</p>

                <img src="https://images.wallpapersden.com/image/download/wukong-free-fire_bGttbG2UmZqaraWkpJRmbmdlrWZlbWU.jpg" width="400px"height="150px" alt="" style="float: left;">
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">Free Fire gamers have the liberty to pair the abilities of multiple characters and build an ideal skill combination that suits their playing style and tactics. Wukong is an overpowered character in Free Fire whom players can use as a primary character and add other character abilities to enhance their efficiency.

                    With a 20% reduction in the movement speed, Wukong's Camouflage active ability transforms the user into a bush. While in bush form, enemies find it harder to target users.The transformation lasts for 15 seconds and if the user attacks, it will end immediately. Camouflage has a lengthy cooldown time (CD) of 200 seconds. Interestingly, this prolonged CD resets when the user takes down an enemy.Since Wukong has an active ability, the remaining three character abilities in the particular combination can only be passive. Therefore, the characters mentioned below come with passive skills.Maxim's Gluttony ability increases the speed of eating mushrooms and using medkits by 25%.

                    In intense combat situations, using medkits is quite a challenging task. Maxim will help Wukong to heal quickly while in bush form. Even if users have 1-2 HP left, they can recover full HP within a few seconds if they have sufficient medkits. Maxim is recommended for Clash Squad matches.</p>
