If players manage to collect all the attachments for the SKS, its performance will increase significantly.The great thing about the SKS is that it has a high spawn rate around the map so players can always grab an SKS to prepare for later long-range fights.

To compensate for this weakness, you should use an AR, shotgun, or SMG along with the SKS.</p>
